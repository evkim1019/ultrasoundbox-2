Having no hydronephrosis makes a ureteral calculus larger then 5 mm unlikely; however in 11-15% of people, there will be no hydronephrosis. This can sometimes happen because the stone is small and non-obstructive. Additionally, patients who are dehydrated will not show hydronephrosis. Oral or IV hydration before obtaining renal ultrasound can increase the sensitivity of finding hydronephrosis in the context of nephrolithiasis.'

If nephrolithiasis is suspected and no hydronephrosis is appreciated on renal POCUS, the US should be repeated after hydration. If still no hydronephrosis is appreciated, it is appropriate to consider alternate diagnoses. In the emergency room it may not be prudent to hydrate the patient and repeat the examination due to time constraints. In this scenario, one can consider immediately obtaining a CT scan to assess for alternative diagnoses or confirm nephrolithiasis, as opposed to attempting PO or IVF hydration.'

        answer: 4,
        explain: 'D. Shadowing artifacts occur when a highly reflective surface, such as the UPJ stone, bounces all of the sound waves back, resulting in no sound waves making it past the stone. The object will be hyperechoic while posterior to it will be anechoic, which is the "shadow" of the object. The structures posterior to the highly reflective object will not be imaged. Reverberation occurs when sound waves bounce off of two highly reflective objects with only some of the signal coming through each time. This causes reverberation of "artifacts" posterior to the reflective surface. Mirroring artifacts occur when objects appear across both sides of a strong artifact. Side lobe artifacts occur when beams outside the central beam are reflected at an angle back to the central beam of the transducer.'
